## What is OneWorldDbClient?

OneWorldDbClient is a DI Component for .NET Core / ASP NET Core for using micro-ORM (like Dapper)  with  EF Core together under combined DB Transaction.

By using OneWorldDbClient, you can safely share and use DB connections and transactions across multiple DI instances.
